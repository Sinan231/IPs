## Overview

This repository provides IP block lists designed to protect your systems from various online threats. The lists target malicious entities such as malware, bots, hackers, and sniffers. By using these block lists, you can enhance your security measures and reduce the risk of attacks.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The lists cover a wide range of threats, including botnets and brute-force attacks.
- **Regular Updates**: We update the lists regularly to include the latest malicious IPs.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with tools like Fail2Ban, iptables, and ipset.

## Topics Covered

- **Blocklist**: A collection of IPs known for malicious activity.
- **Botnet**: Identifies IPs associated with botnet operations.
- **Brute-Force**: Targets IPs that engage in brute-force attacks.
- **CNC**: Addresses command and control server IPs.
- **Compromised**: Lists IPs of compromised devices.
- **Security**: Enhances overall network security.

## Getting Started

To begin using the IP block lists, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Sinan231/IPs/releases). After downloading, follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the necessary commands for implementation.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Latest Release**: 
   - Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Sinan231/IPs/releases) to get the latest files.
   
2. **Extract the Files**: 
   - Use your preferred method to extract the downloaded files.

3. **Implement the Block Lists**:
   - Follow the instructions in the release notes for executing the block lists with your firewall or security tools.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the IP block lists with iptables:

```bash
# Load the block list into iptables
iptables -A INPUT -s <IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the actual IP you want to block.

## Integration with Security Tools

### Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban is a great tool to use alongside these block lists. You can configure it to automatically ban IPs that show malicious behavior.

1. **Install Fail2Ban**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install fail2ban
   ```

2. **Configure Fail2Ban**:
   - Add the block lists to the configuration file.

### Iptables

Iptables allows you to manage network traffic effectively. You can load the block lists directly into iptables to prevent unwanted access.

### IPSet

IPSet can be used to manage large sets of IP addresses efficiently. You can load the block lists into IPSet and then apply them to iptables.

## Block List Format

The block lists are provided in a simple text format, making it easy to integrate into your existing systems. Each line contains a single IP address or CIDR notation.

### Example Block List

```
192.0.2.0/24
203.0.113.5
198.51.100.0/24
```
